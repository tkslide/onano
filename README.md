# onano
Other nano, a parody of a joke of an editor[1].

Aside from being a joke it's a full-screen editor written in _almost_ pure Bash, good and stable enough to be developed in itself.
Still -- if you're looking for a replacement for your Nano (and you really should) -- I'd rather go for Micro, or Vi, or Emacs -- at this point virtually anything will be an improvement.

## Why
Why not?

## Bugs
Yes.
